## Purpose

Rules governing the seam between a spec and the work that implements it. Covers requirements written before their behavior exists, how an entry document in the plan zone cites the rules it enacts, and how coverage is derived. The shape of a requirement is covered by the specs specification. How a spec changes is covered by its lifecycle rules.

This repository keeps no plan zone. Its plan record lives in the project's own plan repository, reached by attachment. No path in this tree names it, and no command here reads it. Every command below is layout-independent.

## Requirements

### `spec-to-code:a-spec-may-lead-its-code` — A spec may lead its code

Where a requirement's behavior does not yet exist, the author MUST represent that state only by its failing verification command.

#### Scenario: A domain is specified before it is built

- GIVEN a spec merged with three requirements and no implementation
- WHEN a reader runs the three verification commands
- THEN the three failures are the backlog, and no marker in the spec restates them

Verify: `rg -in '^status:' . --glob 'SPEC-*.md' && exit 1 || exit 0`

### `spec-to-code:an-entry-document-cites-rule-ids` — An entry document cites rule IDs

When a unit of work changes agreed behavior, the author MUST cite each affected rule ID in the work's entry document.

#### Scenario: A diff changes a spec the entry document never names

- GIVEN a change that rewords a requirement
- WHEN the entry document carries no `MODIFIED` clause for its ID
- THEN review rejects the change, because no command can see the omission

Verify: reviewer compares the spec diff against the entry document's typed clauses

### `spec-to-code:unenacted-rules-are-the-backlog` — Unenacted rules are the backlog

The author MUST derive the set of unenacted rules from the specs and the plan zone on every ask.

#### Scenario: Someone proposes a coverage file

- GIVEN a request for a rules-to-work index under `docs/reference/`
- WHEN the same set is derivable by comparing spec IDs against cited IDs
- THEN the file is refused, because a stored copy drifts on the next change to either side

Verify: reviewer confirms no document stores the agreed-to-enacted mapping

### `spec-to-code:a-comment-cites-the-rule` — A comment cites the rule it satisfies

Where a comment cites an agreement, the author MUST write `SATISFIES` or `VERIFIES` followed by the rule ID.

#### Scenario: A comment cites a rule that no spec defines

- GIVEN a comment carrying `SATISFIES auth:token-expiry-is-bounded`
- WHEN no spec defines that ID
- THEN the citation fails, because a citation that resolves to nothing is a fabrication

Verify: `rg -oI "(SATISFIES|VERIFIES) [a-z0-9-]+:[a-z0-9-]+" . --glob '!{docs,_docs,method}/**' | rg -o "[a-z0-9-]+:[a-z0-9-]+" | sort -u > /tmp/c; rg -oI "^### .[a-z0-9-]+:[a-z0-9-]+." . --glob 'SPEC-*.md' | rg -o "[a-z0-9-]+:[a-z0-9-]+" | sort -u > /tmp/a; comm -13 /tmp/a /tmp/c | grep . && exit 1 || exit 0`

### `spec-to-code:a-gate-message-cites-the-rule` — A gate message cites the rule it enforces

The author MUST make every rule ID a gate prints resolve to a requirement in a spec.

#### Scenario: A rule is renamed and its gate is not

- GIVEN a requirement whose ID changes during review
- WHEN the gate keeps printing the old ID
- THEN the failure message addresses nothing, and the gate reports the unresolved ID

Verify: `pre-commit run gate-message-cites-a-rule --all-files`

### `spec-to-code:a-comment-names-no-record` — A comment names no decision record

The author MUST cite an agreement in code by its rule ID rather than by naming a decision record.

#### Scenario: A branch exists because of a recorded decision

- GIVEN code whose shape was argued for in a decision record
- WHEN the author wants the reason discoverable from the code
- THEN the comment carries the rule ID the record enforces, because the record is frozen and the rule is what binds

Verify: `rg -n "^[[:space:]]*(#|//).*\bADR-[a-z0-9]" . --type-not md && exit 1 || exit 0`

### `spec-to-code:a-suppression-names-its-case` — A suppression names its known-issue case

Where a test is suppressed or left failing, the author MUST name the `KI-<slug>` case at the suppression.

#### Scenario: A suppression names a case that no record defines

- GIVEN an expected failure whose reason is `KI-vendor-drops-the-body`
- WHEN no record under known-issues carries that name
- THEN the suppression fails, because a mask nobody can look up never gets removed

Verify: `pre-commit run suppression-names-its-case --all-files`
